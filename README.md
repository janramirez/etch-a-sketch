# Etch-a-Sketch
Create a 16x16 square grid using JavaScript DOM Manipulation techniques

## TODO
1. Create a webpage with 16x16 grid using square divs.
    - put grid inside a "container" div
2. Set up hover effect so that grid squares change color when mouse cursor passes over them.
    - It should leave a pixelated trail through the grid
3. Add a button that will show a popup asking for size of grid (number of squares per side of the grid)
    - once an input is entered, a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.
